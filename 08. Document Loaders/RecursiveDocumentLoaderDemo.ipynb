      "--- Interactive Documentation Queries ---\n",
      "\n",
      "Query: Explain the key differences between lists and tuples in Python\n",
      "Response: In Python, `list` and `tuple` are two fundamental data structures that can store collections of values. While they share some similarities, there are significant differences between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Differences:**\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Ordered vs Unordered\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **List**: In Python, lists are ordered collections of elements, meaning their order is preserved when inserted or accessed.\n",
      "*   **Tuple**: Tuples are also ordered collections, but unlike lists, they cannot be changed after creation (more on this later). When a tuple is modified, it creates a new tuple and does not modify the original.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Indexing and Slicing\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **List**: In Python, indexing starts from 0, so you can access elements using their position.\n",
      "*   **Tuple**: Tuples also support indexing and slicing, but with some limitations. You cannot create tuples with negative indices or use slicing to access non-existent elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Changeability\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **List**: Lists are mutable collections that can be modified after creation.\n",
      "*   **Tuple**: Tuples are immutable collections that cannot be changed once created.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Unpacking and Iteration\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **List**: You can use `list unpacking` to assign elements from a tuple to multiple variables in a single line, or iterate over the list using a for loop.\n",
      "*   **Tuple**: Tuples are not directly iterable like lists. However, you can create tuples from lists by using the `tuple()` function.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Usage Scenarios\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Lists**: Lists are commonly used for storing collections of elements, such as student records, game data, or user input.\n",
      "*   **Tuples**: Tuples are often used when you need to store a collection of elements with a specific order and cannot change the contents.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Code Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Create a list\n",
      "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
      "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n",
      "\n",
      "# Create a tuple\n",
      "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
      "print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Try to modify the list (this will raise an error)\n",
      "try:\n",
      "    my_list[0] = 'X'\n",
      "except IndexError as e:\n",
      "    print(e)  # Output: list index out of range\n",
      "\n",
      "# Attempting to create a tuple with negative indices raises an error\n",
      "try:\n",
      "    my_tuple = ('a', 'b', 'c')\n",
      "except TypeError as e:\n",
      "    print(e)  # Output: can only concatenate sequence types (not \"tuple\") to str\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while both lists and tuples are used for storing collections of elements in Python, they differ significantly in terms of ordering, indexing, changeability, and usage scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Query: Describe the basic syntax for creating functions\n",
      "Response: You're referring to Python's built-in function creation syntax.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, you can create a new function using the following basic syntax:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "def function_name(parameters):\n",
      "    # function body\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the components:\n",
      "\n",
      "- `def`: This keyword is used to define a function.\n",
      "- `function_name`: The name given to your function. It should be unique and valid in Python (more on this later).\n",
      "- `parameters`: These are the variables that will be passed into your function when it's called. You can have zero or more parameters, separated by commas.\n",
      "- `# function body`: This is where you'll put the code that gets executed when the function is called.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "def greet(name):\n",
      "    print(\"Hello, \" + name)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we define a function called `greet` that takes one parameter, `name`. When it's called, it will print out a greeting message with the provided `name`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Valid function names:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Python has certain rules to ensure your function name is valid:\n",
      "\n",
      "- It must start with a letter or underscore.\n",
      "- It can't contain any spaces.\n",
      "- It can't be a Python keyword (like `if`, `else`, etc.).\n",
      "- It must follow the rule that all words in the variable and the parameter names are PascalCase.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",

      "Query: What are the main control flow tools in Python?\n",
      "Response: **Control Flow Tools in Python**\n",
      "\n",
      "Python provides several built-in control flow tools to control the execution of programs. These tools allow you to make decisions based on conditions and execute different blocks of code accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Conditional Statements (if/else)\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditional statements are used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true, or otherwise execute another block of code.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "x = 5\n",
      "\n",
      "if x > 10:\n",
      "    print(\"x is greater than 10\")\n",
      "else:\n",
      "    print(\"x is less than or equal to 10\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Loops (for/while)\n",
      "\n",
      "Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Output: apple, banana, cherry\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "i = 0\n",
      "while i < len(fruits):\n",
      "    print(fruits[i])\n",
      "    i += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Break and Continue Statements\n",
      "\n",
      "The `break` statement exits the loop as soon as it is encountered.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",

      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    if fruit == \"banana\":\n",
      "        continue\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Try-Except Block\n",
      "\n",
      "The try-except block is used to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of code.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "try:\n",
      "    x = 5 / 0\n",
      "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
      "    print(e)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, if a division by zero occurs, it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` exception. The try-except block catches this error and prints the message.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Finally Block\n",
      "\n",
      "The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "try:\n",
      "    x = 5 / 0\n",
      "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
      "    print(e)\n",
      "finally:\n",
      "    print(\"Finally block executed\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. With Statement (for complex operations)\n",

      "Basic Syntax Summary:\n",
      "This document provides an overview of the fundamental concepts, syntax, and best practices for writing Python code. Here are some key takeaways:\n",
      "\n",
      "**General Tips**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use 4-space indentation**: This is a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read).\n",
      "2. **Wrap long lines**: This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.\n",
      "3. **Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Indentation**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use a consistent indentation style throughout your code (e.g., 4-space or 2-spaces).\n",
      "* Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs (e.g., `f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)`).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Best Practices**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use comments**: Comments are necessary for understanding the purpose of your code.\n",
      "2. **Use docstrings**: Docstrings provide a description of what your function or class does and how to use it.\n",
      "3. **Name variables consistently**: Use uppercase letters for classes, lowercase with underscores for functions and methods.\n",
      "4. **Avoid fancy encodings**: Python's default encoding (UTF-8) is best used in international environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Control Flow Tools**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **if statements**: Used to execute a block of code based on an condition.\n",
      "2. **for statements**: Used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., lists, tuples).\n",
      "3. **Range and enumerate statements**: Used for iterating over a sequence with indices.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Functions**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Default argument values**: Allow functions to be called without specifying all arguments.\n",
      "2. **Keyword arguments**: Provide additional information about function parameters outside of the default parameter list.\n",
      "3. **Special parameters**: Some parameters have special meaning (e.g., `None`, `self`).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Arbitrary Argument Lists and Unpacking**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Arbitrary argument lists**: Used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.\n",
      "2. **Unpacking argument lists**: Used to unpack multiple arguments into separate variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not an exhaustive list, but it covers many of the key concepts and best practices for writing Python code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data Structures Summary:\n",
      "This text is not an actual program or code, but rather a tutorial on Python's virtual environment and package management system, pip. It covers the basics of creating and managing virtual environments, installing packages with pip, and working with requirements files.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key points to note:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Creating a Virtual Environment**\n",
      "\n",
      "* A virtual environment is a isolated directory that contains all the dependencies required by a project.\n",
      "* To create a new virtual environment, run `python -m venv myenv` in your terminal or command prompt.\n",
      "* Activate the environment with `source myenv/bin/activate` to gain access to the environment's dependencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Installing Packages with pip**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The `pip` command is used to install packages for Python.\n",
      "* To install a package, run `pip install <package_name>`.\n",
      "* To list installed packages, use `pip freeze`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Working with Requirements Files**\n",
      "\n",
      "* A requirements file (also known as a \"requirements.txt\") is used to specify the dependencies required by a project.\n",
      "* The file should contain the name of each package and its version number, separated by spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```\n",
      "numpy==1.19.5\n",
      "pandas==1.3.5\n",
      "```\n",
      "**Installing Packages with pip**\n",
      "\n",
      "* To install a package from a requirements file, use `pip install -r <requirements_file>`.\n",
      "* You can also specify the exact package name instead of the full path: `pip install requests`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "```\n",
      "pip install --upgrade requests\n",
      "```\n",
      "This will upgrade the `requests` package to version 2.7.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Managing Packages**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Pip has many options and features, including managing packages with subdirectories.\n",
      "* To list all installed packages, use `pip freeze`.\n",
      "* To remove a package from the virtual environment, use `pip uninstall <package_name>`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to always follow best practices for managing dependencies in your projects!\n",
      "\n",
      "Functions Summary:\n",
