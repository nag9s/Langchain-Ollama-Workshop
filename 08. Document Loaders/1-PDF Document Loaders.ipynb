(META) \\nThird Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call \\nOctober 30th, 2024 \\n \\nKenneth Dorell, Director, Investor Relations \\n \\n \\nThank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Meta Platforms third quarter 2024 earnings \\nconference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and Susan Li, \\nCFO. \\n \\nBefore we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today \\nwill include forward‐looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those \\ncontemplated by these forward‐looking statements. \\n \\nFactors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today’s earnings press \\nrelease, and in our quarterly report on form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Any forward‐looking \\nstatements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no \\nobligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. \\n \\nDuring this call we will present both GAAP and certain non‐GAAP financial measures. A \\nreconciliation of GAAP to non‐GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release. The \\nearnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at \\ninvestor.fb.com. \\n \\nAnd now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark. \\n \\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO \\n \\nThanks, Ken. This was a good quarter with strong product and business momentum, and with \\nparts of our long-term vision around AI and the future of computing coming into sharper focus. \\nWe estimate that there are now more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our apps each \\nday -- and we're seeing rapid adoption of Meta AI and Llama, which is quickly becoming a standard \\nacross the industry. \\n \\nSo let's start with some highlights from the apps. For WhatsApp, the US remains one of our \\nfastest growing countries. And we just passed a milestone of 2 billion calls made globally every \\nday. On Facebook, we continue to see positive trends with young adults, especially in the US. On \\nInstagram, global growth remains strong. We also launched Teen Accounts this quarter, which add \\nbuilt-in protections that limit who teens are messaging and what content they can see. On \\nThreads, the community now has almost 275 million monthly actives. It has been growing more \\nthan 1 million sign-ups per day. Engagement is growing too. So we continue to be on track \\ntowards this becoming our next major social app. \\n \\nWe are making a lot of progress with our AI efforts too, and we're seeing AI have a positive impact \\non nearly all aspects of our work -- from our core business engagement and monetization to our \\nlong-term roadmaps for new services and computing platforms. And I think that this partially \\ncomes from having a vision and roadmap that is aligned with the direction that technology is \\nheading, but even more importantly from our teams doing some really excellent work on execution \\non so many fronts.\")"

      "1. **Eat a healthy and balanced diet**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n",
      "2. **Keep track of your calorie intake**: Use a food diary or an app to track your daily calorie consumption. Aim for a deficit of 500-1000 calories per day to promote weight loss.\n",
      "3. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help control hunger and boost metabolism.\n",
      "4. **Exercise regularly**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or a combination of both, per week. You can also incorporate strength training and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) into your routine.\n",
      "5. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to help regulate hunger hormones and support weight loss.\n",
      "6. **Be mindful of portion sizes**: Use a food scale or measuring cups to measure out your food portions, and eat slowly and mindfully to avoid overeating.\n",
      "7. **Find healthy ways to cope with stress**: Chronic stress can lead to overeating and weight gain. Try stress-reducing techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n",
      "8. **Get enough physical activity outside of exercise**: Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk or bike to work, or do household chores to increase your overall physical activity levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, losing weight is not just about following a specific diet or exercise plan - it's also about making sustainable lifestyle changes that you can maintain in the long term. Consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to create a personalized weight loss plan that suits your needs and goals!\n"

The authors review various botanicals, their primary active constituents, typical use, dosage, and reported adverse effects. They note that concurrent exposure to other compounds and the heterogeneity of herbal supplements can make it difficult to determine the specific mechanism of toxicity. Case reports have identified potential mechanisms for liver toxicity in some botanicals, such as black cohosh, kava kava, saw palmetto, and milk thistle. Other botanicals, such as yohimbe and ginkgo biloba, have been associated with non-hepatic symptoms like seizures and bleeding. The article also discusses potential herb-drug interactions, where the activation of metabolizing enzymes can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs.\n",

      "2. **Kava Kava**\n",
      "\t* Linked to liver toxicity, sometimes requiring transplants\n",
      "\t* Possible mechanisms: depletion of glutathione, increasing oxidative stress, and inhibition of cyclooxygenases (mitochondrial dysfunction)\n",
      "3. **Saw Palmetto**\n",
      "\t* Use has been associated with cholestatic hepatitis and pancreatitis\n",
      "\t* Possible mechanism: alterations in bile secretion\n",
